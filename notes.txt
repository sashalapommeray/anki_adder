right now, when you use the browser extension and click it adds another popup every time you do it so it kinda stacks. how to fix?
eventual goal is to insetad of alerting to send the values in the click to the anki adder script, which will in turn send them to anki

to test go to 
in firefox
about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox

in chrome
chrome://extensions

you have to create your own wanikani sentences note type, otherwise it falls back on the default.
